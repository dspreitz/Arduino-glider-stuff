This project contains stuff, which can be useful to program an Adruino MEGA with glider applications.

All the development I did is based on a Arduino Mega.
I added a temperature & humidity sensor (HYT) to measure both values in flight. My plan is to gather some inflight data correlated with precise timing and GPS information.
Based on this data I want to do some statistical analysis about temperature and humidity distributions within thermals.

To achieve this, I interfaced a Flarm onto the Arduino and rewrote an existing NMEA lib (see lib/nmea) to understand the NMEA sentences provided by flare.
