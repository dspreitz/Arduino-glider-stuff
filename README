This project contains stuff, which can be useful to program an Adruino MEGA with glider applications.

Why Arduino?
Because it offers high level programming in C++ and has lots of libs already available.

Why Arduino Mega?
Because I still had one in my bottom drawer.

Project aim:
Connect different sensors to the Arduino and do in flight measurement. The measured data will be stored on a SD Card shield.

Sensors:
- Temperature und Humidity sensor (HYT)

This sensor is connected to the Arduino via I2C (pins?). It is powered with +5V by the Arduino (pins?)

- Flarm
Flarm outputs NMEA signals. These signals are based on a 12V TTL signal, which has to be shifted to 5V TTL signal. I am using following level shifter http://www.sparkfun.com/products/449 to convert the signal for Arduino input. The level shifter can be powered by the Flarm +3V line.
See chapter 8 of the Flarm installation manual (http://www.flarm.com/support/manual/FLARM_InstallationManual_v5.00E.pdf) for details about the Flarm wiring and which wires provide TX/RX signals.
The shifted Flarm signal is by the Arduino via UART.

Flarm sends following NMEA sentences:
PFLAU, GPRMC, GPGGA and PGRMZ

Further details about these statements can be found under:

Data processing:
All data is processed and written to a terminal, as my SD shield didn't arrive yet. Ultimately, I plan to write the measurements onto a SD Card.

Based on this data I want to do some statistical analysis about temperature and humidity distributions within thermals.
